# Brian Wilde's Web Portfolio

## DESCRIPTION
Originially created as a test of my growing knowledge base in HTML and CSS, this will continue to have links to web projects I create in the future. 

I enjoyed building this portfolio from scratch while utlizing the following techniques new to me:
* Flexbox
* Media Queries
* Pseudo Classes

The Content Management page links I included are pages I actively manage and create content for. I am not responsible for the original design of the CCC website, which was designed by Evans Design Co. However, I am responsible for the layout on several of the indpages, including elements of the homepage and creation of the page content.
